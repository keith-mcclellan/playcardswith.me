With [PlayCardsWith.Me](site) you can play card games together with
*your* rules. [PlayCardsWith.Me](site) provides a collaborative table
you and your friends can join, where you can play cards, just like on
a normal table. The goal is to provide all the features that you need
to play most card games, while letting you decide on the rules
yourselves. This works very effectively when you voice call with your
friends and join a room on [PlayCardsWith.Me](site). Even when you are
all together in the same room, [PlayCardsWith.Me](site) provides a
solution when you can't find your deck of cards!
